Sale Recent Defaults
####################

The Sale Recent Defaults module allows to define a set of sale fields that will
be filled by default with the content of the same fields in the last sale
created by the same user and in the same company as long as the date where the
last sale was created is not older than timeout parameter defined in the
configuration.
